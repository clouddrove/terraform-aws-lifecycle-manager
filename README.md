We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-lifecyle-manager/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "lifecycle-manager" {
      source          = "clouddrove/lifecycle-manager/aws"
      version         = "1.0.1"
      name            = "lifecycle"
      environment     = "test"
      label_order     = ["name", "environment"]

      resource_types  = ["VOLUME"]
      interval        = 24
      interval_unit   = "HOURS"
      times           = ["03:00"]
      count-number    = 44
      SnapshotCreator = "DLM"
      copy_tags       =  true
      target_tags     = true
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| SnapshotCreator | Policy details for customer values. | `string` | `""` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| copy\_tags | tags of false and true. | `string` | `""` | no |
| count-number | How many snapshots to keep. Must be an integer between 1 and 1000. | `number` | `null` | no |
| create\_lifecycle\_policy | Manage Enable or Disable the module. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| interval | How often this lifecycle policy should be evaluated. 1, 2,3,4,6,8,12 or 24 are valid values. | `number` | `null` | no |
| interval\_unit | The unit for how often the lifecycle policy should be evaluated. HOURS is currently the only allowed value and also the default value. | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| policy\_details | Policy details for customer values. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-lifecycle-manager"` | no |
| resource\_types | A list of resource types that should be targeted by the lifecycle policy. VOLUME is currently the only allowed value. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| target\_tags | tags of false and true. | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| times | A list of times in 24 hour clock format that sets when the lifecycle policy should be evaluated. Max of 1. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| dlm\_lifecycle\_role\_arn | Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DLM Lifecycle Policy. |
| dlm\_lifecycle\_role\_id | Identifier of the DLM Lifecycle Policy. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
